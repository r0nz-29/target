    "Guitar Songs is the second extended play by American singer-songwriter Billie Eilish. Written by Eilish and Finneas O'Connell (both pictured), it was released through download and streaming services on July 21, 2022, as a surprise. Eilish decided on the surprise release because she wanted to share new music with her fans as soon as she could. Guitar Songs consists of two realist sentimental ballads, combining simple acoustic guitars that emphasize Eilish's soft vocal performance with personal lyrics that derive from contemporary life events. One of the tracks, \"The 30th\", is titled after the day of a friend's near-fatal car crash: November 30, 2021. In the lyrics, Eilish ponders over whether the friend would have survived had some circumstances in the accident been different. The other track, \"TV\", discusses eating disorders, disillusionment, and a desire for numbness to distract oneself from pressing world issues.",
